## Installing Ubuntu 20.04 (Introduction)

My dad installed Ubuntu version 20.04 on my macbook pro.
He worked almost all night just to install this.
So, for me what makes ubuntu helpful is that Ubuntu is faster and has more features.
Ubuntu is a great operating system to have that way if you at first have a slow operating system, you can have a faster way of opening apps and loading quicker when you sign out.
To me Ubuntu is awesome!

### Working with Ubuntu

As I said in the other paragraph, Ubuntu is much easier to use for an operating system because it has more features and is more faster. One thing you have to have in Ubuntu is terminal. Terminal helps you install apps like tweaks.
Tweaks is an application on Ubuntu that makes configuring you system easier and you can configure your desktop settings.
Tweaks mostly makes configuring you system easier for everyone.
Another thing you can use on Ubuntu is github which is on Firefox Web Browser. 
Github is a website and a cloud-based servicd.
It helps developers store and manage their code.
It also controls changes to your/their code.
Two conected principles you need to know about github are:
Version Control- helps developers track + manage changes to software project's code.
This also lets developers work safely, by branching and merging.


### Date: May 21, 2020 (Quarintine )
Today, in the morning, I worked on a math PDF that I downloaded I think about a month ago. 
That math PDF is called OpenStax. Besides OpenStax, I worked on github on my website page, I worked a bit with my experience I am having with working on Ubuntu 20.04.
This software if much quicker than the other one I had before in this MacBook Pro.
Of course as it says in the title, quarintine, alot of what I write in github is going to be the same.
Like, working on OpenStax math PDF or working on my github page every morning and saying what I did the whole day.
This morning I also helped my mom take care of my brother Ayaan.
I helped him learn the alphabet and how to trace letters, letting him read a story and teaching him how to count. 
After this I took a shower and studied on OpenStax a bit more. This is about what I did the whole morning.

Today, my dad installed texmaker, which is a latex document prepration software, that I will be using to prepare all my documents. 

From now on, I will be creating or modifying documents locally in my laptop, then push everything to my GitHub repository "myLearningTools". My dad showed me a list of commands that I need to execute in the terminal to push (or upload) any documents that create or modify locally in the directory. The list of commands that my dad wrote is given below. 

> git status
> 
> git add .
>
> git commit -m "Some meaningful messages"
>
> git push


Note that, I created COVID-19 folder today and I pushed it under "myLearningTool" repository.

## Installing Ubuntu 20.04 (Introduction)

My dad installed Ubuntu version 20.04 on my macbook pro.
He worked almost all night just to install this.
So, for me what makes ubuntu helpful is that Ubuntu is faster and has more features.
Ubuntu is a great operating system to have that way if you at first have a slow operating system, you can have a faster way of opening apps and loading quicker when you sign out.
To me Ubuntu is awesome!

### Working with Ubuntu

As I said in the other paragraph, Ubuntu is much easier to use for an operating system because it has more features and is more faster. One thing you have to have in Ubuntu is terminal. Terminal helps you install apps like tweaks.
Tweaks is an application on Ubuntu that makes configuring you system easier and you can configure your desktop settings.
Tweaks mostly makes configuring you system easier for everyone.
Another thing you can use on Ubuntu is github which is on Firefox Web Browser. 
Github is a website and a cloud-based servicd.
It helps developers store and manage their code.
It also controls changes to your/their code.
Two conected principles you need to know about github are:
Version Control- helps developers track + manage changes to software project's code.
This also lets developers work safely, by branching and merging.

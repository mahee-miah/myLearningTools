# Mahee's Learning Tools

## My life in Quarintine plus anything else.

### Date: May 21, 2020 (Quarintine )
Today, in the morning, I worked on a math PDF that I downloaded I think about a month ago. 
That math PDF is called OpenStax. Besides OpenStax, I worked on github on my website page, I worked a bit with my experience I am having with working on Ubuntu 20.04.
This software if much quicker than the other one I had before in this MacBook Pro.
Of course as it says in the title, quarintine, alot of what I write in github is going to be the same.
Like, working on OpenStax math PDF or working on my github page every morning and saying what I did the whole day.
This morning I also helped my mom take care of my brother Ayaan.
I helped him learn the alphabet and how to trace letters, letting him read a story and teaching him how to count. 
After this I took a shower and studied on OpenStax a bit more. This is about what I did the whole morning.

Today, my dad installed texmaker, which is a latex document prepration software, that I will be using to prepare all my documents. 

From now on, I will be creating or modifying documents locally in my laptop, then push everything to my GitHub repository "myLearningTools". My dad showed me a list of commands that I need to execute in the terminal to push (or upload) any documents that create or modify locally in the directory. The list of commands that my dad wrote is given below. 

> git status
> 
> git add .
>
> git commit -m "Some meaningful message(s)"
>
> git push


Note that, I created COVID-19 folder today and I pushed it under "myLearningTool" repository. 
 
 ### May 22, 2020 (Another quarintine day)
  Today is May 22, 2020 also known as another quarintine day. This morning I took a shower before starting to work on my github page. 
The cool feature about typing on texteditor is that I don't have to edit on my github page.
Instead I can type on here.
To me texteditor is easier to work on now, I don't have to got to my github page. 
(I know I said that before but I wanted to make it sound more "better" by saying easier.)

Now, it is night time and I am typing here right now. 
I am trying to refresh my memory about what I learned yesterday.
The thing that I was refreshing was that how to push the stuff that I am writing/typing right now to my github page.
Note: My github page website: github.com/mahee-miah/myLearningTools
That is the link above just to remember my website. Now, I will also write reminders to remind myself about anything. 
>Github username: mahee-miah


That is all I need to remind myself for now.
This is all I am typing for today.


### May 23, 2020 (another quarintine day)

Today is May 23, 2020, just another Quarintine day. 
I has some type of hope that tommorow might be Eid, but I was wrong.
So instead it is another quarintine day. 
Almost the whole world is on lockdown.
Only a few countries like Canada lifted lockdown.
USA has now been on lockdown for atleast 2 months and it is almost 3 monthes that USA has been on lockdown.
This is just a message for the people of USA, maintain social distancing.
Anyway, I am working on Github right now just typing everything I am feeling, almost like a diary.
I am just working on github, editing what I have typed so far and all that stuff.
Today, I hope I can do OpenStax and find a way to balance math my other usual school subjects and github. Hopefully I can.
I did work on OpenStax today.
Yay! Now I am going to take a cold shower after typing this and puting it on my github page. Then I am done for the day of math.


What I am now typing is in the evening. My brother Ayaan is watching his favorite "tween" show (which tween would be considered the term for my age.)
I am ten years old, so that is what I mean.
So, the show my brother Ayaan is watching is called monster fish, it is about a guy named Zeb Hogan who catches big fish.
Now, I am working on my github page at night which would technically be considered my coding time.
Also, when I am typing to edit my github page, it is a good way to keep on remembering the commands for terminal. 
The commands for terminal is very important because with one wrong thing, the code could be wrong and there is one way to edit your mistake.
The way you would edit your mistake would be just pressing the up arrow would copy the code you made before and just edit it.
The thing is that the reason you have to type the up arrow key is beause once you actually press the enter key and you can't backspace. 
So, that is why you have to press the up arow key.

Now here are some notes for me.
 >ls
 >
 >cd tab:Documents/myGithubDocs/myLearningTools
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >rm README.md
 >
 >ls
 >
 This is just the code for removing something that I was confused about before.
 Now, that is all I am going type for today.
 
 
### May 24, 2020 (Quarintine day)
 Today is May 24, 2020 another quarintine day.
 As I usually say.
 Usually, we would go to other peoples houses but as it is Quarintine we can't go to other's houses so that is why we did a zoom meeting.
 The uncles had their meeting in the morning and the auties did it at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
 Then tomorrow at 11 am to 12 pm there is going to be a kids meet that I planned as everyone else like the auties and uncles had zoom meetings with each other and us kids want to see eacho other, why don't us kids have a zoom meeting. 
 All of my friends said they are coming except my friend Arisha because my mom said that her mom doesn't answer her calls that is why we didn't invite her but I did want to invite her that way all of us could talk to each other.
 My friend Zaina who now lives in Wisconson also said yes for joining so Zaina and my other friend Nubira can meet virtually.
 Now, these are some notes to remember to remove a document/directory or make a new document/directory. 
 >
 >ls
 >
 >cd (change document)
 >
 > rm -r (document name)
 >
 > cd Documents
 >
 > (Then you will not see the document that you wanted to delete)
 >
 > mdir for make new directory
 >
 
I feel like that is all and tomorrow I will 	type more things as I am not to busy tomorrow, only at 11 am I am going to be busy as I typed in the other paragraph, I created a zoom meeting for us elementary kids.


### May 25, 2020 ( QUARENTINE DAY!)

Today is May 25,2020, as it says in the title.
I had my zoom meeting with my friends.
During that time i friended Zaina, Keyaan, Rifaya, and Raiya on Roblox.
The two that either don't play Roblox or I don't know if that person plays Roblox are Nubira and Aquib.
Ayaan my three year old brother joined the meeting with me.
The auties have another meeting today at 2:00 pm.
Now back to my meeting, the youngest there in the elementary group would be Aquib and the oldest will be me.
The funniest people in the meeting would be Keyaan and Nubira.
I saw Zaina after a long time so I am pretty happy that I invited her to the meeting as I saw her now.
That would be all I did as that is the most exciting part of the day. 
Next, I will talk in the evening.

Now, it is the evening.
I am typing on here to edit my Github page of what I do daily.
So, there is a thunderstorm.
Now, let's talk about what I am doing during this thunderstorm.
So, one of my best friends named Snehal called me on hangouts.
You know google hangouts.
We usually talk there as it is the only place I can talk to Snehal virtually.
We just talk about what we are doing and how is our quarintine going and how are we feeling and stuff like that.


### May 27, 2020 (**STILL QUARINTINE**)
I did not type yesterday because first in the evening I was quite tired and I have to take care of my brother Ayaan.
Second of all, I am reading a wiki book of ubuntu. 
This is to help me learn how to operate Ubuntu.
So that is why I might not type much these days.
I know some of the tricks in github like how to bold words in github and how to make strikethrough as well.
Now I have to learn more in github about how to make your font italic. When I learn you will see in one sentence I will write as an example.
*This is just an example to see italicized font on github.*
Now you saw the example, I still have alot to learn about github and terminal plus mainly how to operate Ubuntu. 
There is a possiblility I might type in the afternoon or at night if there is no rush that I have to keep my brother busy.



### May 30, 2020 (**QUARINTINE** and protesting in US)

Today is May 30,2020. As it says in the title, it is Quarintine, but there is new news. There is protesting in big cities like Minniapolis and Los Angeles because of one person's death. This wasn't due to COVID-19 though. This person died in police custody which means the police officers was treating that person so badly when that person was going to get aressted that the person died. I can't talk much now got to go.



### June 2, 2020 (Another day of Protesting and as usual *Quarintine*)

Today is June 2,2020. There is protesting and there is COVID-19. 
In my personal oppinion, people who live in other countries will start protesting because of this matter. 
So I a watching some TV with my mom and brother watching the news of what is happening in the world and the place we live is now having protesting so not only big cities are the protests, small cities are also having protests.
I am about to go to sleep but I will say why I have not been typing much these days is because I have a schedual that to do math in the morning reading an Ubuntu wikibook in the afternoon and reading 10 pages of it.
The last thing I do for the day is type and push on github which I am also working on a presentation about Ubuntu. Maybe I can type here tomorrow.


### June 3, 2020 (There is still protesting and it is still *Quarintine*)

Today is June 3, 2020, there is protesting and there is COVID-19. Everyone is trying everything they can. 
I did do my schedual like in the morning I was studying the language of Algebra.
Then I did read ten pages of the wiki book of Ubuntu.
Last but not least I am working on my github page for now.
I am trying to find ideas for slides but I still have to work on something in the evening so that is why I am working on README.md.
I have an idea now so I might not type for a few days on the README file. 
Now maybe I can type here tomorrow.


### June 4, 2020 (*Protesting days and Quarintine*)

Today is June 4, 2020. As again it says in the title there is protesting and everyone has to be careful.
When you park the car you have to make sure no one is near it.
And stores like Walmart that are usually open twenty four hours a day now closes at 5:30.
Now, about my day.
I just did the stuff that I usually do like do Openstax in the morning.
Ubuntu Wikibook in the afternoon and at night I am just working on my github page and if I have any ideas then I work on the slides that I am making on Latex.
That presentation is about Ubuntu.
Also some news about me is that I installed grammerly on firefox.
The biggest thing for me is that I learnt it from the book.
This made me really happy.
Also, my friend Nubira came to my house today.
(We made sure to keep our distance like six feet distance.)
They gave us cake which now we have two cakes.
Chocolate and marble cake which I love.
Now maybe tomorrow there is more typing.


### June 5, 2020 (*Protesting and Quarintine*)
<<<<<<< HEAD
I always repeat what there is in the title so anyway.
Today is June 5, 2020.
We always have to stay safe and wear masks if we go outside because as you know there is COVID-19.
Then the other thing you have to be careful of is the protests.
I mean like there are people looting businesses and doing vandlisim and very bad stuff like that.
For me in my personal opinion I would protest with the peaceful protesters.
Not the people doing vandlism and looting and stuff like that.
People now in our place don't even follow traffic rules.
Then some bad people like the people who are doing those things also burn cars.
You have to be careful with were you park your car that way they don't burn your car.
Now enough about the news.
My day was that I worked on OpenStax and I am almost on 1.3 and almost finished 1.2.
I am planning to finish 1.2 tomorrow.
Then in the afternoon I just read the Ubuntu wiki book and soon afterI finish the book I can learn something called emacs gitUI.
Now I am typing here on my README file to update my github page still in some way. That is it for now.
I will type tomorrow hopefully.

### June 6, 2020 (*There is the protesting and Quarintine*)

It's June 6th today and the year is 2020.
The year where all the new stuff came out.
Like Ubuntu 20.04 or Ihpone 11.
There are also bad stuff that came out.
Like COVID-19 and the protesting in the US.
My impressions on protesting.
I support peaceful protesters and how they are doing the protest
Then I don't support the people who are doing vandlism as I said once more again.
How some people are handling this, is just the way I don't get.
How does doing vandlism and looting stores a protest for George Floyed.
Anyway, why talk about this when I can just talk about my day.
Today in the morning I worked on OpenStax at eight o'clock.
Then in the afternoon I had to read the Ubuntu Wikibook that way I learn the commands on terminal and then I can learn emacs quicker.
Then also I have to work on the presentation that I am making.
I finally got an idea on what slide I am going to make.
Like the commands that you could make for terminal like how in some other paragraph I typed.
So I am happy that I finally got an idea.
The idea though won't stop me from typing here on my README file.
I can still update my github page.
More typing tomorrow hopefully.

### June 8, 2020 (**It is national Best friends day!**)
=======

Today is June 8, 2020. 
There is new news today, I searched up in the internet when is BFF's day.
And then today I saw it is national Best Friends day.
So, there is that news.
I won't mention about the protesting and also COVID-19 today because it is a happy day why ruin it but this is just one piece of news that might not be so happy.
Today is George Floyed memorial so that is the downside about today.
Otherwise I feel happy when I figured that out.
Now about my day.
I worked on OpenStax and learned about evaluating Integers.
Also in the morning I helped my brother with his learning on the app he uses called KhanKids.
He loves that app.
Then in the afternoon I learned about Ubuntu LibreOffice the history of it and also I learned that you can make documents and slides and spreadsheets there to.
Then it is night time.
Which I am not sleeping when in central time it is already 11:23 pm.
I slept in the afternoon so it will take me a while till I fall asleep.
Now besides the memorial today I am happy about what I figured out once I say again.
Also I learned another thing new.
It is about github.
The list below is just an example to show what I have learned.

1. example 1
2. example 2
3. example 3
>
and etc.
Hopefully tomorrow if the night is like how I have it now then I will type here once again.



### June 9, 2020 (*Quarintine and Protesting*)

June 9, 2020.
There is the quarintine for at least three months.
Then there is the protesting which there should be no more protesting in the place I live in.
On the news they were showing how George Floyed's funeral was.
There was singing and talking.
Even though it did seem sad.
Now about my day.
I worked on OpenStax to work on my math.
Then in the afternoon I read ten pages of the Ubuntu wikibook that my dad downloaded.
So now at night before working on the slides that I am making I am typing here to also keep the github page still updated with my main file on github.
Now before going I am closing off by saying stay safe.
More typing here tomorrow hopefully.

### June 10, 2020 (*Qarintine and Protesting again*)

Today is June 10, 2020.
My place is on lockdown like the almost the rest of the world and we are stuck inside.
Then protesting for George Floyed.
What I think will happen in the future is that soon the schools will learn about this insident of George Floyed and the protest.
Like my brothers will learn about this when they are in school.
About my day now.
It is just the same thing.
Working on OpenStax in the morning.
Then in the afternoon reading the Ubuntu Wikibook to make notes for the slides that I am making.
Then at night I am working on my README file to make some more updates on the github page and going to work on the slides.
That is about some important stuff about my day.
Which is just the same thing over and over again.
Now here is something interesting.
This is from markdown cheat sheet, the unordered list.
>
-this is the first item
-this is the second item
-this is the third item 
>
And etc.
That is what I learned in markdown.
Now it is time to work on my slides.

### June 11, 2020 (**Quarintine and Protesting**)

Today is June 11, 2020.
Again as I am saying there is **CORONAVIRUS** and **protesting**!
That is why it is getting a little boring at home.
So what I did today in the morning is not OpenStax???????? **WHAT?**O
So what I did today is Freckle.
Freckle is a learning resourse that in my school we use.
There is math, reading, science, and social studies.
There is almost all school subject there in one website.
So I did some of the math which is fact practice.
I practiced my math facts like 9 times 12 or 11-9 and math facts like that.
Then I did a bit of reading.
I read a Realistic Fiction story about two girls that are sisters going to a concert of the beetles.
Later I read nonfiction stories about food like poutine and chocolate and kimchi.
So that is what I did in the morning.
Then in the afternoon as usual I read the Ubuntu wikibook.
I read more than how much I usually read though.
If I have to say myself I think I read quite a lot.
Then of course at night I am working on my laptop README file.
I am planning not to work on my slides today and tomorrow I am planning to work on the slides.
Well got to go.
More typing tomorrow hopefully, (I almost always say the same thing at the last because I can't think of any other closing.)


### June 12, 2020 (**Quarintine and Protesting**)

Today is June 12, 2020.
We are surviving **COVID-19** and **protesting**!
(If you live in any of the countries of Europe or live in the United States.)
I mean COVID-19 everyone in the world is facing , but the protesting is like some countries like the countries in Europe or America.
I feel like the protests in my town are getting better but there is still protesting.
Also we still have to be careful with where we park our cars.
Now what I want to get to now is my day.
So today I was supposed to have a test but then when my mom checked she said it looked good so I did not have the test.
For study though in the morning I did look over my math notebook just in case if I even have the test.
That is what I did in the morning.
Now in the afternoon there was a exciting part.
I finished reading the Ubuntu wikibook.
The downpart about it is that I have to re-read that wikibook all over again.
But the upside about it again is that I can review the stuff that I want to re- learn again by reading again.
So that was the exciting news.
Now in the evening I am working on the README file to update on my day.
Then later I am planning to work on the slides.
I am really happy that I have some more slides but that will make the slides almost a summary of the wikibook.
There is alot of work for me to do.
Well busy busy.
More typing tomorrow if I can get to it tomorrow which I am on fire for these few days.


### June 13, 2020 (**Quarintine and Protesting**)
Today is June 13, 2020.
We are again saying surviving the **CORONAVIRUS** and for some countries **PROTESTING**.
Which are getting out of hand.
There is still news about Coronavirus but now it is less.
Now the news is mainly about the protesting in the countries.
So about my day now.
There is nothing much.
I reviewed the commands you could use for emacs.
Then in the afternoon I showed my brother some plants that we planted in our garden.
Then at night I worked on the slides and I also am working now on the README file.
So there was nothing that exciting.
Stay safe.
More typing tomorrow hopefully.

### June 14, 2020 (**Quarintine and Protesting**)

Today is June 14, 2020.
The whole world is surviving **COVID-19**.
Some of the world is surviving the **protesting.**
Which again I am saying that I think that the protest is getting out of hand.
For some of the cities in the United States like Seattle it really is getting out of hand.
Like how there is a city inside a city with no police allowed.
That place is called C.H.A.Z.
With no police allowed is bad because people there could be doing illegal stuff.
This is just scary.
In some places like in my town now people are peacefully protesting.
About my day now.
Today in the morning I worked on Freckle and read about sushi and Maple Syrup and I finished reading about Chocolate.
The afternoon I was having a nice foot spa by putting my feet in water.
Also I played in the water with my brother.
Then in the evening me and my family went out for a drive.
We went to riverplex which is very pretty with a lake or river there.
When we came home we cleaned ourselves up.
I washed my hair and also washed my hands and face.
Plus I had to change my clothes.
Then we watched news and are now watching monster fish.
I am working on my slides and the README file.
Now that is it.
Quite a quick day.
More typing tomorrow.


### June 15, 2020 (**Quarintine and of course Protesting!**)

Today is June 15, 2020 
As I am saying again.
The whole world is surviving **COVID-19**.
Some of the world is surviving the **protesting**.
I don't have much news today but in the United States some one got killed because of the Police.
That is all I know.
I did not pay attention to the news today.
I am now still pretty scared again as I am saying.
About my day.
I worked on Freckle and read about sushi and I am starting to read about curry and where it originated.
Next in the afternoon I had the foot spa with my brother again like I did yesterday.
Then in the Evening, as for us it is coconut water day for us me and my family drank coconut water.
Also I was working on the slides and now also working on my README file.
So like yesterday it was a quick day.
Hopefully I can type again tomorrow.


### June 19, 2020 (**Quarintine and Protesting**)

Today is June 19, 2020.
I am typing again at a different time.
There is a reason.
So, two days ago, I accidentally deleted all my files in mygithubdocs when I was only trying to delete one.
Then that time I did not know how to fix it.
So I asked my dad for help.
He did not even finish the process.
That is why for another day after that happened I tood a day off to relax my mind about what I did and then thinking that tomorrow (which is now today) I will try to fix it.
Then today, I fixed it by using terminal git clone then the link for my github page.
After I did that I got everything like my presentation and README file and also my COVID-19 file.
Then I learned something new on Markdown cheatsheet. 
So below this line I will show you what I learned.

1. Fenced code block: {
                         "firstName": "Mahee",
                         >
                         "lastName":  "Miah",
                         >
                         "age": 10
                       }  
>
That is what I learned and I wanted to try the fenced code block.
There will be typing tonight or in the afternoon.



### June 20, 2020 (It is soon Father's day which is tomorrow!)

Today is June 20, 2020.
I decided I will type here in the morning and in the evening if I am not so caught up on the book that I am currently reading.
Now I just remembered that to talk about the book that I am currently reading.
The book is called Rapuzel and the lost lagoon.
It is about one princess which is Rapunzel and the daughter of the captin of the gaurd who later becomes Rapunzel's lady in waiting.
Together they go to a secret lagoon that hold's the treasure of the kingdom.
What lead them there is one riddle they found.
Rapunzel and Cassandra who is the daughter of the captin have to find the secret though before someone more *sinsister* does.
So that was now what I am currently reading.
Then in the morning like very early I woke up to walk with my dad outside.
Then we also ran abit.
That was a good 1 hour excersize we had outside.
More at the evening.

It is now the evening.
My brother is now watching pj masks and I am working on github.
I also forgot to talk about a new card game that I learned.
It is called Solitair.
It is more like you need to go in order when you count and also you have to know the ranking like king queen jack.
Then you go into counting from ten nine eight seven six five four three two.
There is no number one.
Then there is the aces that you put on the top that the rank is even higher than the king.
All the cards that are matching the shape like the two of diamonds goes to the ace of diamonds.
Also you have to match them by color.
like black red black red.
Then I also talked abit with my friend.
To be specific one of my best friends.
That is about my day.
Bye Bye.


### June 21, 2020 (*Today is Father's day!*)

Today is June 21, 2020.
It is father's day today.
Also for my family it is ice cream day.
So I guess why don't we have ice cream for father's day and my dad can eat ice cream first.
Anyway I have a plan when I am eating ice cream later.
So that is also why I am going to let my dad eat first.
For the last two days I have been going outside with my dad to run.
On the first day I woke up at four o'clock then later I went to run with him.
Then on saturday I woke up at five o'clock which I did not mind later.
Then today I could not go because we were both sleeping.
I am going to do openstax right now.
More in the evening.


Horray! It is the evening.
I would have also typed here in the afternoon but our internet connection was not working.
So if I wanted to check my work in github firefox I was worried that it would not work.
That time I was board.
Then in the afternoon after lunch for desert I had vanilla ice cream and some strawberries on the side.
That was just to fill in about the afternoon.
Then in the evening I am planning to make some lemonade with my mom.
I feel so hot.
I am also now watching youtube on our TV.
Stay safe!

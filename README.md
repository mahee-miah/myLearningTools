## Installing Ubuntu 20.04 (Introduction)

My dad installed Ubuntu version 20.04 on my macbook pro.
He worked almost all night just to install this.
So, for me what makes ubuntu helpful is that Ubuntu is faster and has more features.
Ubuntu is a great operating system to have that way if you at first have a slow operating system, you can have a faster way of opening apps and loading quicker when you sign out.
To me Ubuntu is awesome!

### Working with Ubuntu

As I said in the other paragraph, Ubuntu is much easier to use for an operating system because it has more features and is more faster. One thing you have to have in Ubuntu is terminal. Terminal helps you install apps like tweaks.
Tweaks is an application on Ubuntu that makes configuring you system easier and you can configure your desktop settings.
Tweaks mostly makes configuring you system easier for everyone.
Another thing you can use on Ubuntu is github which is on Firefox Web Browser. 
Github is a website and a cloud-based servicd.
It helps developers store and manage their code.
It also controls changes to your/their code.
Two conected principles you need to know about github are:
Version Control- helps developers track + manage changes to software project's code.
This also lets developers work safely, by branching and merging.


### Date: May 21, 2020 (Quarintine )
Today, in the morning, I worked on a math PDF that I downloaded I think about a month ago. 
That math PDF is called OpenStax. Besides OpenStax, I worked on github on my website page, I worked a bit with my experience I am having with working on Ubuntu 20.04.
This software if much quicker than the other one I had before in this MacBook Pro.
Of course as it says in the title, quarintine, alot of what I write in github is going to be the same.
Like, working on OpenStax math PDF or working on my github page every morning and saying what I did the whole day.
This morning I also helped my mom take care of my brother Ayaan.
I helped him learn the alphabet and how to trace letters, letting him read a story and teaching him how to count. 
After this I took a shower and studied on OpenStax a bit more. This is about what I did the whole morning.

Today, my dad installed texmaker, which is a latex document prepration software, that I will be using to prepare all my documents. 

From now on, I will be creating or modifying documents locally in my laptop, then push everything to my GitHub repository "myLearningTools". My dad showed me a list of commands that I need to execute in the terminal to push (or upload) any documents that create or modify locally in the directory. The list of commands that my dad wrote is given below. 

> git status
> 
> git add .
>
> git commit -m "Some meaningful message(s)"
>
> git push


Note that, I created COVID-19 folder today and I pushed it under "myLearningTool" repository. 
 
 ### May 22, 2020 (Another quarintine day)
  Today is May 22, 2020 also known as another quarintine day. This morning I took a shower before starting to work on my github page. 
The cool feature about typing on texteditor is that I don't have to edit on my github page.
Instead I can type on here.
To me texteditor is easier to work on now, I don't have to got to my github page. 
(I know I said that before but I wanted to make it sound more "better" by saying easier.)

Now, it is night time and I am typing here right now. 
I am trying to refresh my memory about what I learned yesterday.
The thing that I was refreshing was that how to push the stuff that I am writing/typing right now to my github page.
Note: My github page website: github.com/mahee-miah/myLearningTools
That is the link above just to remember my website. Now, I will also write reminders to remind myself about anything. 
>Github username: mahee-miah


That is all I need to remind myself for now.
This is all I am typing for today.


### May 23, 2020 (another quarintine day)

Today is May 23, 2020, just another Quarintine day. 
I has some type of hope that tommorow might be Eid, but I was wrong.
So instead it is another quarintine day. 
Almost the whole world is on lockdown.
Only a few countries like Canada lifted lockdown.
USA has now been on lockdown for atleast 2 months and it is almost 3 monthes that USA has been on lockdown.
This is just a message for the people of USA, maintain social distancing.
Anyway, I am working on Github right now just typing everything I am feeling, almost like a diary.
I am just working on github, editing what I have typed so far and all that stuff.
Today, I hope I can do OpenStax and find a way to balance math my other usual school subjects and github. Hopefully I can.
I did work on OpenStax today.
Yay! Now I am going to take a cold shower after typing this and puting it on my github page. Then I am done for the day of math.


What I am now typing is in the evening. My brother Ayaan is watching his favorite "tween" show (which tween would be considered the term for my age.)
I am ten years old, so that is what I mean.
So, the show my brother Ayaan is watching is called monster fish, it is about a guy named Zeb Hogan who catches big fish.
Now, I am working on my github page at night which would technically be considered my coding time.
Also, when I am typing to edit my github page, it is a good way to keep on remembering the commands for terminal. 
The commands for terminal is very important because with one wrong thing, the code could be wrong and there is one way to edit your mistake.
The way you would edit your mistake would be just pressing the up arrow would copy the code you made before and just edit it.
The thing is that the reason you have to type the up arrow key is beause once you actually press the enter key and you can't backspace. 
So, that is why you have to press the up arow key.

Now here are some notes for me.
 >ls
 >
 >cd tab:Documents/myGithubDocs/myLearningTools
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >gedit README.md
 >
 >cd
 >
 >ls
 >
 >rm README.md
 >
 >ls
 >
 This is just the code for removing something that I was confused about before.
 Now, that is all I am going type for today.
 
 
### May 24, 2020 (Today is Eid!)
 I did not type today in the morning because, today is Eid al-fitr. 
 There are two Eids in one year. One is after Ramadan and the other is courbani Eid which when we maybe possibly August or September I will talk about that.
 The day when Eid comes is decided by the moon.
 When it is a thin cresant moon that means that the next day will be Eid.
 Usually, we would go to other peoples houses but as it is Quarintine we can't go to other's houses so that is why we did a zoom meeting.
 The uncles had their meeting in the morning and the auties did it at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
 Then tomorrow at 11 am to 12 pm there is going to be a kids meet that I planned as everyone else like the auties and uncles had zoom meetings with each other and us kids want to see eacho other, why don't us kids have a zoom meeting. 
 All of my friends said they are coming except my friend Arisha because my mom said that her mom doesn't answer her calls that is why we didn't invite her but I did want to invite her that way all of us could talk to each other.
 My friend Zaina who now lives in Wisconson also said yes for joining so Zaina and my other friend Nubira can meet virtually.
 Now, these are some notes to remember to remove a document/directory or make a new document/directory. 
 >
 >ls
 >
 >cd (change document)
 >
 > rm -r (document name)
 >
 > cd Documents
 >
 > (Then you will not see the document that you wanted to delete)
 >
 > mdir for make new directory
 >
 
I feel like that is all and tomorrow I will 	type more things as I am not to busy tomorrow for Eid, only at 11 am I am going to be busy as I typed in the other paragraph, I created a zoom meeting for us elementary kids.


### May 25, 2020 ( QUARENTINE DAY!)

Today is May 25,2020, as it says in the title.
Today is also the Second day of Eid al-fitr as Eid al-fitr lasts for three days. 
I had my zoom meeting with my friends.
During that time i friended Zaina, Keyaan, Rifaya, and Raiya on Roblox.
The two that either don't play Roblox or I don't know if that person plays Roblox are Nubira and Aquib.
Ayaan my three year old brother joined the meeting with me.
The auties have another meeting today at 2:00 pm.
Now back to my meeting, the youngest there in the elementary group would be Aquib and the oldest will be me.
The funniest people in the meeting would be Keyaan and Nubira.
I saw Zaina after a long time so I am pretty happy that I invited her to the meeting as I saw her now.
That would be all I did as that is the most exciting part of the day. 
Next, I will talk in the evening.

Now, it is the evening.
I am typing on here to edit my Github page of what I do daily. 
This is like a diary to me.
So, there is a thunderstorm.
Now, let's talk about what I am doing during this thunderstorm.
So, one of my best friends named Snehal called me on hangouts.
You know google hangouts.
We were talking about how one of our friends that will go to second grade has some people from out of Peoria and some people who live in the Prarie Vista apartments.
To me that is dangerous cause of the current situation of Illinois for COVID-19.
What I am surprised about is that howcome no one is calling the police.
Snehal showed me what her dad was working on and her dad is training to be a pilot.
That is one of the things I did in the evening.

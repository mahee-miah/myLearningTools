## Installing Ubuntu 20.04 (Introduction)

My dad installed Ubuntu version 20.04 on my macbook pro.
He worked almost all night just to install this.
So, for me what makes ubuntu helpful is that Ubuntu is faster and has more features.
Ubuntu is a great operating system to have that way if you at first have a slow operating system, you can have a faster way of opening apps and loading quicker when you sign out.
To me Ubuntu is awesome!

### Working with Ubuntu

As I said in the other paragraph, Ubuntu is much easier to use for an operating system because it has more features and is more faster. One thing you have to have in Ubuntu is terminal. Terminal helps you install apps like tweaks.
Tweaks is an application on Ubuntu that makes configuring you system easier and you can configure your desktop settings.
Tweaks mostly makes configuring you system easier for everyone.
Another thing you can use on Ubuntu is github which is on Firefox Web Browser. 
Github is a website and a cloud-based servicd.
It helps developers store and manage their code.
It also controls changes to your/their code.
Two conected principles you need to know about github are:
Version Control- helps developers track + manage changes to software project's code.
This also lets developers work safely, by branching and merging.


### Date: May 21, 2020 (Quarintine )
Today, in the morning, I worked on a math PDF that I downloaded I think about a month ago. 
That math PDF is called OpenStax. Besides OpenStax, I worked on github on my website page, I worked a bit with my experience I am having with working on Ubuntu 20.04.
This software if much quicker than the other one I had before in this MacBook Pro.
Of course as it says in the title, quarintine, alot of what I write in github is going to be the same.
Like, working on OpenStax math PDF or working on my github page every morning and saying what I did the whole day.
This morning I also helped my mom take care of my brother Ayaan.
I helped him learn the alphabet and how to trace letters, letting him read a story and teaching him how to count. 
After this I took a shower and studied on OpenStax a bit more. This is about what I did the whole morning.

Today, my dad installed texmaker, which is a latex document prepration software, that I will be using to prepare all my documents. 

From now on, I will be creating or modifying documents locally in my laptop, then push everything to my GitHub repository "myLearningTools". My dad showed me a list of commands that I need to execute in the terminal to push (or upload) any documents that create or modify locally in the directory. The list of commands that my dad wrote is given below. 

> git status
> 
> git add .
>
> git commit -m "Some meaningful message(s)"
>
> git push


Note that, I created COVID-19 folder today and I pushed it under "myLearningTool" repository. 
 
 #### May 22, 2020 (Another quarintine day)
  Today is May 22, 2020 also known as another quarintine day. This morning I took a shower before starting to work on my github page. 
The cool feature about typing on texteditor is that I don't have to edit on my github page.
Instead I can type on here.
To me texteditor is easier to work on now, I don't have to got to my github page. 
(I know I said that before but I wanted to make it sound more "better" by saying easier.)

Now, it is night time and I am typing here right now. 
I am trying to refresh my memory about what I learned yesterday.
The thing that I was refreshing was that how to push the stuff that I am writing/typing right now to my github page.
Note: My github page website: github.com/mahee-miah/myLearningTools
That is the link above just to remember my website. Now, I will also write reminders to remind myself about anything. 
>Github username: mahee-miah
>
>Github password: 10112Nbrookshire

That is all I need to remind myself for now.
This is all I am typing for today.


##### May 23, 2020 (another quarintine day)

Today is May 23, 2020, just another Quarintine day. 
I has some type of hope that tommorow might be Eid, but I was wrong.
So instead it is another quarintine day. 
Almost the whole world is on lockdown.
Only a few countries like Canada lifted lockdown.
USA has now been on lockdown for atleast 2 months and it is almost 3 monthes that USA has been on lockdown.
This is just a message for the people of USA, maintain social distancing.
Anyway, I am working on Github right now just typing everything I am feeling like a diary.
I am just working on github, editing what I have typed so far and all that stuff.
Today, I hope I can do OpenStax and find a way to balance math my other usual school subjects and github. Hopefully I can.
I did work on OpenStax today.
Yay! Now I am going to take a cold shower after typing this and puting it on my github page. Then I am done for the day of math.

*Storing GitHub username/password for Emacs/doomEmacs*

When fetching, pulling, and/or pushing a repository from GitHub using Doomemacs, it asks for my github username and password every time I perform a git operation (pull,push, fetch) from my gitHub repository. It's a hassle/annoying!!

For that, all what I did is pulled changes from my repository using doomEmacs, then enter  /username/password/ (personal access token, generated for commandline git operation!). Then open /eshell/ and enter the following command

#+begin_quote
git config --global credential.helper store
#+end_quote
